Interview-ready explanation (clean & confident)

“Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a technique where we combine search with generation.
Before the LLM answers, we retrieve the most relevant pieces of information from an external
knowledge base using embeddings, then condition the LLM on that context so the answer is accurate,
grounded, and up-to-date.”

What is RAG :

RAG = letting an LLM look up the right notes before it answers.
Simple explanation (non-technical)

A normal LLM answers from memory.
RAG answers after reading your documents.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Embedding :

Embeddings turn text into numbers so a computer can compare meaning, not keywords.
Now the why, specifically for your RAG project


An embedding is a vector (list of numbers) that represents the semantic meaning of text.
Similar meaning → vectors are close
Different meaning → vectors are far apart

LLM = speaks
Whisper = hears
Embeddings = understands similarity
Vector DB = memory
