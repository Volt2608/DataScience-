    "# 1. Why Train Once and Save?\n",
    "# Training models repeatedly is time-consuming and computationally expensive.\n",
    "# Saving the model (model.pkl) and preprocessing pipeline (pipeline.pkl)\n",

    "# Raw data needs to be cleaned, scaled, and encoded before model training.\n",
    "# A Pipeline automates this transformation and ensures identical preprocessing during inference.\n",

    "# 3. Why Use Joblib?\n",
    "# joblib efficiently serializes large NumPy arrays (like in sklearn models).\n",
    "# Faster and more suitable than pickle for scikit-learn objects.\n",
