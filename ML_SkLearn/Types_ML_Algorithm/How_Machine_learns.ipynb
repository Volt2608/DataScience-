    "# “Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to \n",

    "# And a more engineering-focused one:\n",
    "\n",
    "# “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some\n",
    "# task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, \n",
    "# improves with experience E.” — Tom Mitchell, 1997\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let’s break that down with the spam filter example:\n",
    "# Task (T): Identify whether an email is spam or not\n",
    "# Experience (E): Examples of labeled emails (spam or ham)\n",
    "# Performance measure (P): Accuracy — how many emails are correctly classified\n",
    "# If the system keeps getting better at flagging spam based on past emails, it is said to be learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The examples used to train the system are called the training set, and each individual example is a training instance (or sample). The part of the ML system that does the actual learning and prediction is called the model. Think of the model as the brain that’s being trained.\n",
