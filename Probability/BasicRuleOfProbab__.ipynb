    "\n",
    "# 1. Important Definitions\n",
    "# In probability, understanding the basic definitions is crucial for grasping more complex concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Experiment: An action or process that leads to one or more outcomes (e.g., rolling a die). Deterministic experiments have predictable outcomes, while probabilistic or random experiments have uncertain outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Outcome: A possible result of an experiment (e.g., rolling a 3 on a die).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Probability (P): A measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).\n",
    "\n",
    "# P(AUB): The probability of event A or event B occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "# P(A∩B): The probability of both events A and B occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample Space (S): The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Event (E): A subset of the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mutually Exclusive Events: Two events that cannot occur at the same time (e.g., rolling a 2 and rolling a 5 on a die). P(A∩B)=0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Independent Events: Two events where the occurrence of one does not affect the other. P(A∩B)=P(A)⋅P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Certain Event: An event that is guaranteed to happen, with a probability of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Impossible Event: An event that cannot happen, with a probability of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exhaustive Events: A set of events that cover the entire sample space, meaning at least one of them must occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Tossing a die:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample space: S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
